The project manager and team are responsible for managing trade-offs associated with delivering the required levels of both quality and grade. Prevention is preferred over inspection. It is better to design quality into deliverables, rather than to find quality issues during inspection. The cost of preventing mistakes is generally much less than the cost of correcting mistakes when they are found by inspection or during usage. Project managers may need to be familiar with sampling. Attribute sampling (the result either conforms or does not conform) and variable sampling (the result is rated on a continuous scale that measures the degree of conformity). Many projects establish tolerances and control limits for project and product measurements. Tolerances (the specified range of acceptable results) and control limits (the boundaries of common variation in a statistically stable process or process performance). The cost of quality (COQ) includes all costs incurred over the life of the product by investment in preventing nonconformance to requirements, appraising the product or service for conformance to requirements, and failing to meet requirements (rework).

It’s not a replacement for traditional or agile project management approaches; but it does enhance them. These approaches are like gears and Wicked Problem Solving is akin to the oil or lubricant that makes the gears run more smoothly. And once we know how to tame a wicked problem, we can use the same scalable principles and practical methods to address virtually any class of problem we encounter—from simple to team to strategic. What are the principles of Wicked Problem Solving? The principles of WPS are rooted in cognitive science and incorporate elements of design thinking, lean and agile practices. I’ve learned that we tend to do our best work when we a) organize tasks into a series of “plays,” b) work in collaboration with others and c) apply these principles and plays into a path consistently to address any challenge we face. A “play” is the basic building block of Wicked Problem Solving. It involves:1. Leading with a key question – a clear articulation of the problem we’re seeking to solve. 2. Making ideas visible – creating a shared visual representation of the issue to help team members think through the problem. We mean this literally. WPS is highly visual; we seek to get to the essence of the problem through drawings. 3. Engaging with tasks – laying out an activity to help teams work through and solve the problem."

           "How can organizations go about on the hard work of getting started in building agile cultures? Here are some ways organizations might consider getting started. 1. Recognize it will take time. Cultural change never happens overnight, requiring a great deal of patience—while still coupled with the urgency and bias for action inherent in agile approaches. Maintaining employee (or to use a more appropriate word, talent) engagement over this long time-horizon can be enhanced by encouraging them to find motivation in learning and continuously mastering their craft. 2. Focus on improving systems. Culture ultimately is a reflection of management systems in place; therefore to change a culture, overall systems must be evolved as well. For example, it’s increasingly come into vogue for leaders to take public steps to address the challenge of non-stop ad hoc requests pouring in via email and instant messages. Some CEOs have even called for steps like “email-free Fridays”; but a culture that has taken form around expectations for rapid-fire responsiveness can’t meaningfully change beyond an individual level, unless an organization completely re-thinks its approach to how information is shared and retrieved. 3. Strive to foster joy. Attracting great talent and fostering innovation requires building an environment that encourages talent to view the workplace as something that can be fun and even joyful, not a place of drudgery. Done right, more of what we consider to be work can feel like play. Experiments and experimental-based work tends to enhance the feeling of joy that teams feel; I’ve seen firsthand a variety of experimentation-based approaches work very well, as seen in trends like the DevOps and Lean movements."

But they’ve all embraced the opportunity to work more deeply and intensively with local chapters to advance PMI’s mission in their region. Right now, we’re seeing this manifested most clearly in how they’re engaging with members and volunteers and in the local programs they’re launching. Take our Youth initiative, for example. Some regions are engaging young people by holding competitions, others are doing meet-ups and more are forging partnerships with local youth organizations. What’s important is that they’re able to operate in the way that is most effective for their region, drawing upon the unique culture and capabilities of the markets they serve. This will pay dividends as we expand our reach beyond our core audience of project professionals to engage a wider circle of changemakers, as we’re doing in our Youth programs. We’ll need more culturally-attuned resources, more customized products and more local “boots on the ground” to capture the hearts and minds of these stakeholders. This, in turn, will create more leadership opportunities for our members and volunteers. And it will drive more collaboration—among chapters within a region but also among the regions themselves as they share ideas, experiences and best practices."

           "Roughly 32 percent of organizations surveyed could be described as gymnastic, and they differ markedly from traditional enterprises:Gymnastic enterprises are more likely than traditional organizations to have high levels of organizational agility and to make frequent use of standardized risk management practices.They are much more likely to have undergone significant change across their business during the pandemic—especially in the areas of digital transformation and business strategy.And they are much more likely to have increased productivity and to have less wasted investment.What accounts for these differences and the stronger performance of gymnastic enterprises? We believe it has to do with the ability of gymnastic organizations to create changemakers—those who, regardless of their role, feel personally inspired and equipped to turn ideas into reality. They do that by helping their people work smarter in three ways.First, gymnastic organizations master different ways of working—taking a more balanced and customized approach to the project at hand, whether that involves using Agile, predictive or hybrid approaches. They also outpace traditional enterprises in the use of advanced technologies, including cloud solutions, the Internet of Things, AI and 5G mobile internet. More importantly, they use technology to augment human skills and help their people continuously improve. They prioritize the enterprise-wide adoption of complex problem-solving techniques, AI-driven tools, on-demand, microlearning apps and career assessment tools. The second way gymnastic enterprises work smarter is by elevatingpeople-centered skills—what we call power skills—to ensure effective leadership and communication. They place the highest value on collaborative leadership but also prize adaptability, an innovative mindset and empathy. Finally, gymnastic organizations recognize the value of business acumen—fostering well-rounded employees who not only have expertise in a specific role or project, but also understand how their efforts relate to the broader business environment, their company’s strategic objectives and other parts of the business.Building an environment in which changemakers thrive, however, doesn’t just happen. Two other ingredients are necessary: the right organizational culture and executive leaders who identify the culture and capabilities they want and put in place the talent management practices that reinforce those behaviors.Gymnastic enterprises, for example, are far more likely than traditional enterprises to prioritize many aspects of organizational culture, especially delivering customer value, aligning with organizational values and embracing digital solutions. Senior leaders at gymnastic enterprises are also more likely to be guided by organizational values and to prioritize the development of project management skills across the enterprise. And gymnastic organizations surpass traditional enterprises in many aspects of talent management, particularly performance management and learning and development. All these findings suggest that gymnastic enterprises have a significant competitive edge over traditional organizations. They are better able to sense and respond to shocks, drive change and face the future, knowing that they have the mindset, the skills and the tools it takes to win. By enabling their employees to work smarter, elevating power skills and building business acumen, gymnastic organizations are well-positioned to deliver superior financial and societal value."

           "These challenges can be addressed by first developing a greater understanding of the right citizen development approach. There are essentially three kinds out there: Pure citizen development - a user can use tools to create a new, straightforward app.Citizen development with some degree of IT assistance - the user can mostly run with their idea but may require some support from a trained citizen development architect or IT professional. This also demands an agile approach, ideally a Disciplined Agile one, given the amount of collaboration and iterating that is likely taking place. This will likely be the most relevant path at many organizations.IT-development - the third path is one where the idea starts with business users, it is determined that the project is too complex for a citizen development approach, so the IT team needs to step in due to the complexity of the project."

        "responses":[
           "High-level planning, of course, is complicated—with plenty of room for error. But if you can’t always get everything right, at least you can get fewer things wrong. Recognizing this reality, we built the airfocus prioritization process around four key steps:  First, manage feedback from your customers. By listening to your customers and users, organizing the feedback they share and linking it to your already available roadmap ideas and projects, you can receive truly valuable insight to help enhance decision-making. Market insights—whether from internal sources like sales data and web analytics or external sources like industry reports and competitive benchmarking—also help validate ideas, reduce risk and make data-informed decisions possible. Having a centralized idea management system allows your team to analyze, rate and validate ideas to ensure they align with your vision and high-level strategy. Second, define a prioritization framework. A framework is a standardized process that allows you to assign values to different activities so you can decide what to do next. It replaces gut instinct with smart scorings and allows you to filter out subjective input and guesswork when making decisions. You can use one of the seven widely recognized frameworks included in the airfocus eBook or you can create your own. Either way, it’s important to have a repeatable, scalable process to help make prioritization and tradeoff decisions. This, in turn, will foster confidence in the decisions your team is making.Third, execute the prioritization framework. The scoring used in the prioritization process considers different criteria such as value, cost, risk and timing. You can also assign different weightings to the criteria. The system then scores the various options between zero and one hundred and helps visualize the results. Rigorously applying this standardized process reduces error and eliminates the bias that can often creep into decision-making. Finally, put together a roadmap based on the prioritization outputs to visualize both the short- and long-term direction of your project, as well as the steps needed to deliver against your goals. A roadmap is thus both a strategic and action-based document. It will and should change frequently and should be shared with colleagues and management. We’ve therefore provided a roadmapping tool in airfocus that is easy to update, allows you to focus on the content rather than design and ensures a visually appealing end-product."

           "Some takeaways and key recommendations from the report:  To the maximum extent possible, agile should become the preferred operating model across the federal government. For example, agile should be a cornerstone of the President’s Management Agenda, which articulates how to best modernize government services to deliver on mission outcomes, and Cross Agency Priority Goals, ensuring that agile management is used whenever appropriate. Agile methods of management and operations should be championed inside federal departments and agencies—and incorporated into as many of their activities as possible. Department and agency leaders should make it a point to seek out, support and champion agile programs and projects already underway, as well as assessing their organizations’ levels of agile readiness. The key barriers to agile functioning within the federal government should be identified—and appropriately addressed within the nation’s checks-and-balances political system and legal framework. Leaders in the Office of Management and Budget, the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management should make it a priority to identify barriers, both regulatory and statutory, that stand in the way of making agile management an expected way of doing business, far beyond just IT projects. Agile approaches, successes and challenges should be highlighted across the federal government. Agile government agencies would hew to some proven principles—making the “customer” the top priority, emphasizing learning and iteration and empowering staff to delegate decisions to the lowest possible levels to cut through roadblocks. Department and agency leaders should ensure that training opportunities about agile principles and approaches—especially management skills—are readily accessible. To that end, agile management should be a standard component of federal training programs, and agencies should work with educational institutions to incorporate agile into their curricula and practical learning experiences."

           "Reinvent your business model by leveraging exponential technologies. Technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), 3D printing and robotics are themselves growing exponentially and have the power to transform organizations. Rather than resist changes they could hold for current business models, we need to embrace these new tools and make them our own.  Understand the power of the crowd. In our hyper-connected world, we now have the ability to crowdsource solutions to many intractable problems. No one these days can “go it alone.” Why not leverage the power of crowds to speed you along your way, drawing from the insights of many others?  Become a data-driven, experimentalist organization. Stop searching for the silver bullet. Rely instead on data, rapid experimentation and the ability to iterate to achieve the outcomes necessary to thrive in our fast-changing world.  Citizen development is very much in tune with an exponential mindset. It’s not only growing exponentially—as my prediction suggests—but it has the power to unleash exponential growth in your organization.  Giving people access to low-code/no-code tools is, after all, a form of crowd-sourcing and iterative experimentation. It empowers your teams to take control of their work lives—allowing them to produce software and apps that automate and scale processes so that they can do their jobs faster, cheaper, better. What’s more, they no longer have to wait in line for IT to provide development resources and support.  Now, multiply that impact exponentially across your organization, as every function and department applies the transformative power of technology to their area of the business. Enterprise productivity would soar, as software development becomes faster and less costly. And you would accelerate time to value and achieve outcomes more quickly."

        ],
        "responses":[
           "Learning #1: Transformation Starts from Within: Rapid transformation doesn’t start at the organization level, it starts with the person within, said Yvonne Lau, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, at Li & Fung Limited. Transformations are hard work, demanding strength, resilience and unrelenting drive. In many cases, it requires a personal transformation to marshal these special attributes and bring them to the workplace every day. Hard-core transformation work therefore requires a certain amount of self-examination and self-care—physical, emotional and spiritual. We must get our own house in order before we can take on the demanding work of transforming our organizations and broader society. Learning #2: Deliver Positive Impact for Society. Which leads to the next key learning: Organizations today cannot transform successfully in an unsustainable world fraught with grave economic and societal challenges. It’s no longer possible or desirable to compartmentalize business and the broader society in which we operate. Organizations are now beginning to look at social impact as part of the strategic agenda and not something that is isolated or treated as disruption, said Carolina Da Costa of Maua Capital. It has to be seen as value added to the business. It’s important to view your transformation efforts in the context of the larger challenges facing business and society—and to help create the conditions that will allow your business to thrive. That can mean conserving the natural resources that are essential for business operations or fostering a more equitable social structure so that people can afford to buy your products. Another consideration—many studies suggest that consumers today are more willing to buy from and support companies that are seen as fulfilling their societal responsibilities. Learning #3: Unleash the Power of Human Capital. Transformations can only be successful if leaders take everyone with them on the journey. Yet, one of the biggest roadblocks to transforming an organization is that people are full of fear. Indeed, Gallup estimates that 85 percent of our workforce is disengaged. We have a new generation and a new model of work that’s emerging, and we need a whole new approach to talent management, said Don Tapscott, noted author and Executive Chairman of Blockchain Research Institute. Building a culture of teamwork is critical in any successful transformation. That means engaging employees around a real mission and instilling a sense of purpose behind the work. In an era of distributed teams and remote working, it’s also important to harness the power of technology to drive collaboration and to compensate for some of the social structures we’ve had to give up due to the pandemic. Learning #4: Lead with Courage and Empower the Frontlines. Leaders of transformations need to step up their game. In the words of Deepa Prahalad, author, innovation consultant and CEO of Anuvva LLC, leaders have to become creators of common ground—the ones who manage all the competing demands across teams and keep us moving in the right direction. In fact, many organizations have created the role of Chief Transformation Officer or CTO to ensure they have the right leadership at the helm of their transformation efforts. But leadership today also means letting go—empowering team members on the frontlines to innovate and take action. That involves creating a safe space for people to interact with technology at scale and to take on the role of Citizen Developer—capable of creating software and apps tailor-made for the project at hand. Imagine a world where anyone who wants to [can] build their own app, said Alwin Magimay, Senior Managing Director, FTI Consulting. This could be a citizen revolution. Learning #5: Clearly Communicate and Connect with your People. Leaders today need clarity of ambition, according to Matthew Bell, Senior Vice President at AstraZeneca—a clear understanding of the type of value they can deliver. But that vision also needs to be clearly communicated to team members and transformation stakeholders. And it needs to resonate emotionally."

           "Given this great potential, what can you do to create the right operating model for citizen development? Here are several areas to focus on: Foster power skills. Often mischaracterized as “soft” skills, power skills emphasize traits that are very much aligned with citizen development. Leaders with strong power skills are open and willing to think differently. They value creativity and innovation. They move fast, collaborate and put personal agendas aside to focus on delivering value to customers. Focus on change management. Bringing citizen development into an organization is a massive culture change. Leaders need to provide context for why citizen development is necessary and outline the principles that will guide its implementation. Most important, they need to make sure that people understand the outcomes they’re looking to achieve. The change management aspects of any citizen development initiative are critical in driving acceptance and buy-in, and in helping avoid disruption or misunderstanding across the organization. Identify champions of change. To aid in this culture change, it’s useful to identify individuals who are comfortable with change and who are willing to champion the citizen development movement within their organization. These people—who frequently possess the power skills discussed above—can expedite the culture change and get it moving in the right direction. Provide governance guardrails. As has been widely noted, companies should create a clear governance model for their citizen development efforts. The biggest hurdle in implementing citizen development isn’t technical. It’s giving employees a framework for their work that complies with the organization’s IT standards and mitigates risk. These guardrails need to be clearly communicated and understood. In the end, you want to harness the power of citizen development to address your biggest pain points and business problems without losing what your IT people have worked so hard to build over the decades.    Create symbols of success. Look for opportunities to post early wins in your citizen development efforts. The best way to do this is through the development of pilot programs that allow you to test citizen development—to gather important lessons on what works and what doesn’t work and to generate excitement for this new approach to business within your organization."

In fact, we’ve just launched the first of an upcoming series of courses on the topic. Organizational Transformation: Foundation (OTF) lays out five building blocks for effective transformation along with best practices on managing the people and strategy involved in such company-wide efforts. Transformation Starts with the Individual: In the end, Professor Tabrizi says, all transformation is personal; it starts with the individual. He even recommends that leaders undergo a personal transformation before attempting to drive transformation throughout their organizations. This cultural aspect of transformation is why we recommend that internal project managers and their teams—rather than outside consultants—lead transformation efforts. They are in a much better position to ensure that the effort reflects the organization’s values, and their involvement is likely to result in faster turnaround times. According to Brightline’s Strategic Transformation research, organizations that transform quickly are twice as likely to focus on developing internal talent. Establish Your Credibility as a Transformation Leader: Organizational Transformation: Foundation requires five to 10 hours to complete. It features nine modules of key concepts and best practices via case studies, activities, articles, videos and quizzes. Upon completion, you will be eligible to take a short quiz and earn a micro-certification demonstrating your expertise in the foundations of business transformation. The micro-certification allows for immediate credibility that you possess the knowledge and passion required for large-scale transformation work. OTF is the first, foundational course in PMI’s upcoming Organizational Transformation series, which will also include an intermediate and an advanced course. These additional courses will also have micro-certifications available upon completion and will be released later in 2021."

           "As a business leader at Tech Mahindra, a multinational technology company, I have the ability to bring together data available both internally and externally to my organization to equip our employees with the business logic necessary to determine how to solve a problem and achieve the desired output. By knowing the business logic, these employees can then chart out a workflow process, add some screens to it, and deploy the solution with the click of a button to scale across verticals. Although my description of citizen development sounds simple enough in theory, as part of an enterprise, business users need to make a case for the potential value it will bring to the business before launching a proposed solution. And for the solutions to prove successful within the enterprise, there also need to be guardrails in place, such as: 1 - Establishing a secure and safe governance structure. As part of an organization, it is important to have a singular, structured framework that adheres to guidelines from the IT department and also incorporates best practices that are uniformly available to all business users across the organization. Having standards in place allows business users to be IT governance and security compliant right from the start. Nevertheless, the governance structure should not restrict innovation, but rather serve as a guide to use citizen development safely and securely. It is imperative to protect the company from threats such as software breaches or hackers. 2 - Allowing innovation and scalability. Once a structure is established, it’s important to grant the ability to create business applications to the business users. By ensuring that business users feel empowered to use the low-code, no-code applications that are available to them, organizations are allowing for mobilization and scalability across all departments. 3 - Relying on industry experts for support. To really scale, there are many dimensions to consider. That is why at Tech Mahindra, we rely on top industry leaders such as PMI for resources on best practices, tools and methodologies for incorporating citizen development in a compliant manner."

        "responses":[
           "What exactly does agile for grown-ups look like in practice? A few traits come to mind: 1 - They keep their focus on outcomes, not frameworks. The “adults in the room”—those who have been through their share of project debriefs and seen how the best laid plans can blow up in the implementation phase—understand that frameworks can have a way of boxing you in if they are all you know (what Ivar Jacobson calls “method jail” or “framework prison”). 2 - If you only know Scrum, it quickly defines the language of any project you’re tackling, even when Scrum may not necessarily be the answer, such as when you’re working on a project with a very defined time and scope. You quickly find yourself hitting the limit of whatever problem Scrum can solve, or SAFe, or any other framework. The net result of a “framework first” perspective is akin to telling someone to go swimming—and then placing weights around their ankles. 3 - They understand that there is no such thing as a best practice. I wish there was, but I’ve been looking for a very long time. In the end, every practice is contextual in nature. For example, Kanban will work well in some situations; not in others. 4 - There’s nothing magical about any one of these frameworks. This can be frustrating if you’re counting on a best practice to solve most of your problems, but the messy reality is that you will still have work to do. 5 - They view experimentation as a necessity. High-performing organizations across sectors and industries tend to share something in common—adopting the Kaizen Loop, an approach in which teams experiment with small changes in their way of working (or WoW, my single favorite acronym). If you look at some of the “apex predators” who dominate their industries—the Googles, Amazons, and eBays of the world—you’ll notice their common ability to pivot without losing momentum."

And, of course, if an application fails, then it falls on the IT department to fix it. They also worry about the complexity that may result, exposing the enterprise to significant risks and impacts on adjacent systems and interfaces that sit behind old working practices.

And now, you’re proposing that you give some—if not all—of that control to others in the business who don’t necessarily appreciate the interconnectivity of systems and sub-systems.

Thirdly, there must be a format in which the plug and play can happen across the various low-code and no-code vendors and allow people to share their applications.”Gurnani believes that PMI, with its deep expertise in developing global standards and certification training, is ideally positioned to help drive adoption of citizen development, serving as an objective resource for organizations looking to apply citizen development tools and methodologies thoughtfully."

In the short term, early movers can create a solution to a problem in a fraction of the time and cost that a traditional software house might deliver. This is exciting in the current times where digital transformation has to be fast, can’t be waterfall-based, and even agile may be too slow.   Gurnani says One can’t afford to miss out on citizen development. I believe it is the next big wave and again, the role of governance is critical. At Tech Mahindra, we are confronting this in many ways. We have situations where the software solution got developed in two to three weeks, but gaining the security approvals took months. It is critical to create a governance framework that your client or business is comfortable with—one that covers the main issues of governance, security, data protocols, and more. That’s where PMI can help educate and enable individuals and organizations."

And they must quickly master three key dimensions of the transformation process: new business logic, customer pull, and new technologies. In short, it’s no longer enough for project managers to master the normal tricks of the trade such as planning and scheduling. In a time when technology has automated many recurring, repeatable aspects of work, project professionals are likely to spend much more of their time on the areas of work where humans still have the advantage over machines, such as sensing and responding to the needs of customers and team members in a distributed environment and driving realization of business value."

        ],
        "responses":[
           "Technology is essential, but not enough: Often, we are busy chasing the latest technological innovations, viewing them as the means to digitally transform our organizations. It’s easy to forget that it's actually people who drive change—people working together to fulfill common goals. A virtual workforce needs more than clinical assurances about infrastructure, technologies, and systems security. It is crucial to create bonds that connect people, whether it's a manager to her team or a business to its workforce. A workforce connected by trust will benefit from improved agility, flexibility, and enhanced staff morale. When there's trust, progress skyrockets, and businesses move faster on their digital transformation journeys. Trust must be baked into your organization’s culture. Consider Siemens' new remote work policy , about which CEO Roland Busch says, “We trust our employees and empower them to shape their work themselves so that they can achieve the best possible results.” That’s an example of baking trust into your culture. Benefits of Remote Work Go Both Ways: I believe the option to work outside the office is the greatest workplace transformation of our time. Remote work allows employees to achieve better work-life balance by eliminating long commute times, increasing flexibility, and making it possible to live wherever one finds the greatest personal happiness. Businesses benefit from remote work as well. Research shows  that workplace flexibility boosts profitability as well as employee productivity, performance, engagement, and retention. Many businesses may still be nervous at the prospect of allowing their employees to work and collaborate outside the office. Why? I believe the issue goes beyond technology. Companies can easily find vendors with solutions that support remote work. The issue continues to come down to organizational culture and trust. Remote but Not Alone: At the Project Management Institute (PMI), practically our entire global staff is working virtually right now—an unprecedented shift for us, as with many organizations. We have learned a great deal over the last several months; for one thing, it has become evident that a majority of roles don’t require employees to be in the office to get the job done. I am not minimizing the human need for social connection. And as my CEO Sunil Prashara recently noted, collaboration and relationship building often come more naturally in person. But, with most employees working from home, the business is functioning perfectly well as it did before our work-from-home requirements went into effect."

Nearly all jobs involve some aspect of project management, whether it’s planning, budgeting, scheduling or stakeholder management. So, there are likely a wealth of opportunities to develop and hone your professional skills right where you are. 2 - Get training: While on-the-job experience is invaluable, you’ll also want to obtain formal training and, ideally, become certified in the practice of project management. Your company may be able to help. Sixty-one percent of Pulse respondents report their organizations provide project management training, and 47 percent have a defined career path for project professionals. 3 - Commit to life-long learning and community involvement: Ideally, CAPM certification is just the first of many steps in your project management career. Our field is constantly evolving—with new ideas and new ways of working emerging as project managers adapt to a changing business and societal landscape."

        "responses":[
           "While there is no single, magical formula that will make your multifaceted strategic transformation a success, here are the some ways you can start creating the right conditions to master your organization’s strategic transformation: - Ensure you have right resources. Investment in the right resources—particularly the right technologies and the right talent—is directly tied to successful strategic transformation. Cutting-edge technology landed the number one spot for the most significant competitive advantage high performers have in order to successfully implement strategic initiatives. But competitive advantages like cutting-edge technology and effective leadership cannot take flight without top talent. In fact, faster-transforming organizations were nearly twice as likely as slower-transforming respondents (34% vs. 19%) to report a greater focus on developing internal talent. As such, implementing effective hiring and talent development systems should be an organization’s highest priority not only during pivotal times in its transformation, but every day. Further, organizations should rigorously and continuously assess and support the development of their talent to augment long-term competitive success. - Lean into leadership. Strong leadership remains one of the key determining factors as to whether or not a transformation initiative will take flight or fall flat. Leaders looking to guide their teams to true transformation should have a clear vision, concrete goals and the confidence and ability to disseminate an action plan to the right people across the organization. If your organization doesn’t already have a Chief Transformation Officer sitting on your executive bench, consider adding this important position; they will serve as a centralized orchestrator for devising and delivering upon strategic transformation objectives. - Formalize processes. Organizations actively striving to become more adaptive and “gymnastic” should consider formalizing their processes to drive fast and effective transformation. No matter how talented your people and cutting-edge your technologies, an organization needs a North Star—including standardized processes—in order to maximize talent and technology and, ultimately, enhance transformation. With processes in place, an organization will find a greater degree of adaptability, take full advantage of the tools at its disposal and course-correct when overcoming strategic challenges."

These included commonly available tools like Microsoft Teams, OneNote, and Skype, which became widely used in a matter of days or weeks once employees started working from home. These tools are now proving so valuable that they’re likely to remain in place long after the crisis is over. Beyond their technology recommendations, Council members also offered advice around communications and management practices. It’s important during a crisis, they said, to check in more frequently with our teams and to hold regular staff meetings so that all team members know what everyone else is working on. In fact, some Council members said the best strategy for navigating disruptive change is to practice what we preach in terms of staying agile. As one member noted: Agile teams have been dealing with change for more than 20 years. If all this seems tailor made for times like this, there’s one other aspect of agile that we should bear in mind as we’re dealing with COVID-19 or any disruptive change: keeping an eye to the future. Our world has fundamentally changed as a result of COVID-19. As we emerge from the crisis, we will face hard decisions about how we do business and what remote work practices we want to pull forward as new operating norms. There are, after all, benefits to our new virtual work style. As one Council member noted, it encourages inclusiveness and diversity and gives people more geographic options for where they live and work. It also minimizes distractions and may bolster productivity in terms of “deep work” that requires high levels of focus and concentration."

Making key project elements visible to the entire team provides a real-time overview of the project status, facilitates knowledge transfer, and empowers team members and other stakeholders to help identify and solve issues.; Project knowledge management: The increasingly mobile and transitory work force requires a more rigorous process of identifying knowledge throughout the project life cycle and transferring it to the target audience so that the knowledge is not lost.; Expanding the project manager’s responsibilities: Project managers are being called on to initiate and finalize the project, such as project business case development and benefits management. Historically, these activities have been the responsibility of management and the project management office, but project managers are more frequently collaborating with them to better meet project objectives and deliver benefits. Project managers are also engaging in more comprehensive identification and engagement of stakeholders.

A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after another activity in a schedule. These relationships: 1. Finish-to-start (FS): A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware is assembled (predecessor). 2. Finish-to-finish (FF): A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document (successor) can finish. 3. Start-to-start (SS): A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins. 4. Start-to-finish (SF): A logical relationship in which a predecessor activity cannot finish until a successor activity has started.

When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known differences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project. Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also less accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates have the needed expertise."

Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost, budget, and duration. Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor hours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by the number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor hours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to install 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour). This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model.

The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity. 3 - Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity. Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE, can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution: tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3. Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Duration estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of uncertainty around the expected duration."

Resource leveling: A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when shared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are overallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as shown in Figure 6-17), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can often cause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical path through the project schedule may change. 2. Resource smoothing: A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for resources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to resource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In other words, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able to optimize all resources."

In other words, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able to optimize all resources."

           "Schedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the project scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique is the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposed date, the total float can become negative. 1. Crashing: A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources. Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery to activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources will shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in increased risk and/or cost. 2. Fast tracking: A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a building before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased risk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical path. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities concerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs."
